# 🍯 Honey Production Forecasting – Data Analytics Project

**Year:** 2023  
**Tools:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting honey production trends using historical data. By applying a **linear regression model** with Scikit-learn, the project demonstrates how data science techniques can be used to predict future outputs in agricultural industries.
